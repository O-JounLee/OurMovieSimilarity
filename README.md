# OurMovieSimilarity
OurMovieSimilarity (OMS) is the crowdsourcing platform for collecting the cognitive similarity from users.
The OMS was built based on Java Web Application and Model-View-Controller model combine with the MySQL server.
The OMS is run by KEL (Knowledge Engineering Labotary) at Chung-Ang University. By using OMS, you will help us develop new experimental tools and interfaces for data exploration. The OMS system is non-commercial.
